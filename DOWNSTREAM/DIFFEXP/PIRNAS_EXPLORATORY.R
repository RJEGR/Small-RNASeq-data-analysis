# Considerations and complications of mapping small RNA high-throughput data to transposable elements (read paper: Alexandros Bousios1* , Brandon S. Gaut2 and Nikos Darzentas3)

# The challenges of mapping sRNAs to TEs are exacerbated by the fact that accurate TE identification is a notoriously difficult task.

# TE-derived dsRNA can lead to gene or TE silencing or to activation of the interferon response (Lanciano S. 2017 Measuring and interpreting transposable element expression)

# PIWI genes and piRNAs are ubiquitously expressed in mollusks and show patterns of lineage-specific adaptation (DOI: 10.1038/s42003-018-0141-4)
